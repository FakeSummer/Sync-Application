# Sync-Application

Sync Application is a CLI application that will synchronize two local directories at regular intervals. 

## Installation

This application is a proof of concept at the moment, but to test just run SyncApp.exe. The application defaults to E:\ currently.

Known Issues:

- The application does not store username/password information between sessions. The folders remain and can be routed to with the same login information.
