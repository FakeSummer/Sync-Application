# Sync-Application

This application synchronizes a specific folder client-side with a folder server-side as a means of backing up files and accessing files from a cloud-like storage. Created mostly for HTTP practice and sharpening my skills, though collaboration with colleagues to create a front-end web interface is planned.

This repo is for the client-side application only.

## Installation

This application is a proof of concept at the moment.
